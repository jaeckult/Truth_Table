This repo contains a java file which that implements a truth table generating program. The program takes input logical statement to be executed and it has no limitation when it comes to the input size. It works for all the conditional operators (I have used the common symbols for logical operators and try as much as possible to use the right symbols) and logical variables can be of any types.
